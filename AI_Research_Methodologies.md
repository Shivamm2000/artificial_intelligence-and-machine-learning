## Symbolic (or Classical ) AI:
 - Logic and Knowledge Representation: Involves using formal logic to represent and manipulate knowledge. Knowledge is often represented using symbols and rules.
 - Search and Planning: Focuses on developing algorithms that can search through large solution spaces to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to problems.

## Connectionist (or Neural Network) AI:
 - Machine Learning: A subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow systems to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data.
 - Neural Networks: Modeling systems based on the structure and function of the human brain, involving layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that can learn to recognize patterns.
 - Deep Learning: A subfield of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to learn complex representations.

## Evolutionary Algorithms:
 - Genetic Algorithms: Inspired by the process of natural selection, genetic algorithms use evolutionary principles to search through solution spaces for optimal or near-optimal solutions.
 - Genetic Programming: Extends genetic algorithms to evolve computer programs or solutions, often represented as tree structures.

## Bayesian Networks and Probabilistic Graphical Models:
 - Probabilistic Reasoning: Involves representing uncertainty and making decisions based on probability theory. Bayesian networks are graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships.

## Reinforcement Learning:
 - Reward Based Learning: Agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
 - Markov Decision Processes: Mathematical models used to describe decision-making in situations where an agent interacts with an environment over time.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP):
 - Linguistics and Computational Linguistics: Understanding and generating human language, incolving syntactic and semantic analysis.
 - Machine Translation: Developing algorithms and models for automatic translation of text between different languages.

## Human-AI Interaction:
 - Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): Studying how humans interact with AI systems, designing interfaces, and considering ethical implications.
 - Explainability and Interpretability: Researching methods to make AI systems more understandable and interpretable to humans.

## Robotics:
 - Computer Vision: Enabling machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data.
 - Motion Planning: Developing algorithms for autonomous robots to plan and execute movements in a physical environment.
